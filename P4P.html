    <h1>Perform 4 Purpose</h1>
    <p>
      Mission: " Perform 4 Purpose was formed for the charitable purpose of
      fostering and encouraging youth involvement in the arts in the Central New
      York area, by providing opportunities for live performance events that
      will benefit local charitable needs in our community. We seek to include
      events for those involved in all forms of artistic expression such as
      music, theater, and dance. To this end, we are committed to establishing a
      family-oriented organization that provides children a safe, wholesome
      environment where they can experience the joy and wonder of live
      performance, while developing skills to make better life choices and
      become contributing members of the community."
